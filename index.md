### CPSC 120

* Lab 10
   
    Lab 10, part 2 was a favorite because it really inroduced me to 2D vectors. In this Lab the goal was to wrote a program that orginazes California's population data by the country using vectors and arguments. This lab also was an expression of [modular programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_programming), in which I found quite intriguing and hope to learn more about.

* Lab 4

    Lab 4, part 1 was a favorite of mine as it involved converting a measurement of volume from mililiters in the metric system to various other units in the US customary system (such as cups, oucnes, tablespoons and teaspoons). Part 1 involed using a lot of double varaibles as multiple digit integers were needed. It also involved using some math as it required for specific equations that will respond correctly to different test case inputs.

* Lab 8

    Lab 8, part 1 was a favorite because I enjoyed making a program inspired by the word game [Mad Libs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Libs). In this lab, the task was to make a program that fills in blanks for a sentence about a sandwhich order by following a pattern of command-line arguments that contain components of a sandwhich. It reminds me of ordering at a restaurant because if you don't get the input valid and correct, the output will be incorrect, which can create some very angry customers!
